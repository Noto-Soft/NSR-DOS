The bootloader starts the OS in unreal mode automatically, with A20 enabled.
The unrealized segment is FS. Do not modify FS or anything utilizing unreal mode will break. (The EGA character write routine utilizes it as of 0.98, which is indeed a problem that would be hard to debug!)
To get the memory available between 1mb and 15mb in kilobytes, read from fs:0x80000, or 0x8000:0x0000.

OUTDATED:
To get the memory available after 16mb in 64kb blocks, read from fs:0x8f002, or 0x8f00:0x0002.
this is false now
