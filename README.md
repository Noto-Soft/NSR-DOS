NSR-DOS IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH 8088/8086!<br />
DON'T TRY RUNNING ON YOUR IBM XT!!<br />
idk why but qemu spoiled me and im now realizing that it doesn't actually work on an actual 8086 emulator thats meant for 8086 emulation so fate.<br />
VERSION 0.98_b2+ REQUIRE A 386 OR NEWER!!!<br />
## note
when running build.sh make sure you change it to an lf line breaks file because git is annoying and just does that for no reason
## warning
the bsod is ear exploding so either turn your volume down or don't mess anything up
