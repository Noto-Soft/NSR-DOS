Notosoft PC Speaker Music Format (NSPSMF)
Music is stored in .spk files

The file is filled with a contiguous list of "entries" which are 7 bytes long

Each entry is a special byte that's usually 0, word for the rounded frequency of the note, and then a dword of how long to play it (in microseconds) before going to the next entry.
If the special byte is 0, the note is played like normal.
If the special byte is 1, it turns off the pc speaker. (Before setting the frequency)
If the special byte is 2, it turns on the pc speaker. (After setting the frequency)
If the special byte is 3, it marks the end of the song. The PC speaker is automatically turned off.
If the special byte is 4, the frequency is not set but the delay still runs.
