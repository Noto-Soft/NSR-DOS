safecall calling convention (used by all interrupts)

	the arguments are passed through registers
	all registers, except registers holding return values, are preserved
through pushes and pops by the callee
	parts of registers should be preserved too, eg
if there is a return value in al, ah still must be preserved
	return values through registers

	!!!!!!! this calling convention is very bad
dont use it
