The Noto-Soft Executable Format (NSXF)

header stuff::
version 1.0 should never ever be used

Version 2.0 header:
"AD" followed by 0x02, then 0x00 to denote the major and minor versions,
then a word pointing to the starting point of the program

version 2.1 is officially deprecated

protocall stuff (2.0+)::
always, the drive number is passed to the program through dl before jumping
to the program. this is always expected. even if you're program
doesn't use floppy, you need to keep track of it if you call any other
programs
