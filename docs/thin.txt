[Info sector (includes info about the filesystem)] | 1
[Entry sectors] | 3 or more usually
[File sectors] | entire disk - boot sector, info sector, entry sectors

2 free bytes, can fit a short jump in here to possibly extend the boot sector
11 bytes padded by spaces representing the name of the filesystem byte
representing amount of entry sectors
entry sectors layout ---
each entry comes right after another
entry layout -----------
word for the lba of the file
byte for the length in sectors

file sectors span from the end of entry sectors to the end of the disk
so they do not need to be specified
