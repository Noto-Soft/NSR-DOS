"AD" followed by 0x02, then 0x00 to denote the major and minor versions,
then a word pointing to the starting point of the program

version 2.1 is officially deprecated

protocall stuff (2.0+)::

to the program. this is always expected. even if you're program
doesn't use floppy, you need to keep track of it if you call any other
programs

"ES" followed by a word pointing to
the starting point of the program, then 20 bytes reserved
for expansions

header, data section, text section

protocall for 3.0+::
the segment the program is loaded in should always be zeroed. following free segments MAY be zeroed, but dont always count on it
